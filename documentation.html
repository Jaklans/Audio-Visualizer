                <p>For this project, we used audio analyser to generate an array of frequencies. We then took those and manipulated them into PIXI Graphics. The data was also used to interpolate the color for each line. We used HTML/CSS to make the interface/UI designs.

                The songs we used belong to their perspective artists, we do not own them.</p>

                <p>In order to meet the project requirments, we created a functional and creative web application. Our visual design is simple yet pleasing to see, and we have included different modes for the user to experience. Our interface is also easy to use. We used PIXIJS for our graphics and animations, as well as using audio analyser for our array of audio frequencies. Both our HTML and CSS validate as well. A Vector class is created to hold scene dimensions, fulfilling the requirement for an ES6 Class, and the HTML 5 exclusive color input is used to get a user specified color for the simulation.
                <br><br>
                In order to go above and beyond, we have included different styles of audio visualizer that user can pick from, as well as allowing the user to choose two colors, which range will be displayed through PIXIJS Graphics. A significant amount of time and effort also went into debugging and finding solutions to adress memory leaks and general memory management for large amounts of changing PIXIJS Graphics objects.
